# MyHealthApp

The MyHealth App has been developed for an NGO incollaboration with Frugal Innovation Lab and Sparrow Mobile. <br>
This is a desktop application, where the administrator can create the profiles for other admins, patients and doctors and would have access to edit or delete any profile.<br>
The administrator has the following additional features.<br>
1. Book a group appointment for the patients and assign a particular doctor.<br>
2. Feeds the appointment information in the patient's mobile and provide the reminders (for example : in an interval of 7 day, 3 day, 1 day, 5 hrs etc.) for the appointment in the form of pop ups.<br>
3. Feeds the medicines and corresponding time to take them in the patient's mobile and provide timely reminders in the form of pop-ups.<br>
4. In case the patient doesn't respond to the reminders, the coordinator tracks the patient's treatment and would follow up with the patient.<br>
5. Feeds the pharmacy information in the patient's mobile in case of refilling the medicines.<br><br>

This app is developed using AngularJS for the UI.<br>
